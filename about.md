Thank you for visiting my blog.

My name is Arogya Koirala, and in this blog I talk about the intersection of technology, media and policy in the context of the small Himalayan country of Nepal.

I will be aiming to post at least a couple of articles every month that cover the following concepts (in no particular order):

- The role that effective data visualization and interactive content can play in investigative journalism of today,
- The emerging need for journalists of today to expand their competencies to serve these needs,
- The state of technology policy in Nepal, and current efforts to improve the same,
- The state of the open data initiative that is currently under way in Nepal
