An assessment of global indicators on governance and accountability suggest that Nepal's position has historically been rather weak. We have consistently underperformed in the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators (2009), ranking below the fiftieth percentile in all six dimensions of transparency and governance. The Global Integrity Report (2009) paints a similar picture[[^2]], where underperformance in categories such as executive, legislative and judicial accountability has resulted in Nepal gaining an overall status of a "Weak" (67/100) nation. This is unsurprising, given Nepal's political instability over the last few decades, coupled by its history of taking a rather exclusionary approach at governance.

Tides may be turning though, as easier access to inexpensive technology, and increased efforts by independent organizations and volunteers to improve government transparency has paved the way for what is now known as "open data movement" in Nepal. In this context, efforts of Open Nepal, a collaborative initiative that aims to make government information more accessible to the general public have been monumental. By supporting individuals and governemnt organizations to open up data for the public, and making available 800+ datasets through Nepal's first online open data portal, the organization has been playing an intrumental role in fostering the information ecosystem in Nepal.

Given the efforts of initiatives like Open Nepal, it has now become more important, more than ever, to equip citizens with the necessary know-how to analyse and play with information. After all, data is nothing but ammunition, which cannot be used unless citizens jnow how to operate their 'analysis' guns. With external partners and INGOs actively encouraging the use of open data to improve transparency, accountability and citizen participation [[^3]], identifying mechanisms that encourage the use of open data could be key to achieving government accountability and transparency and fostering a data driven culture in the country.
