An assessment of global indicators on governance and accountability suggest that Nepal's position has historically been rather weak. We have consistently underperformed in the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators (2009), ranking below the fiftieth percentile in all six dimensions of transparency and governance. The Global Integrity Report (2009) paints a similar picture[[^2]], where underperformance in categories such as executive, legislative and judicial accountability has resulted in Nepal gaining an overall status of a "Weak" (67/100) nation. This is unsurprising, given Nepal's political instability over the last few decades, coupled by its history of taking a rather exclusionary approach at governance.

Tides may be turning, however, as easier access to inexpensive technology, and increased efforts by independent organizations and volunteers to improve government transparency has paved the way for what is now known as "open data movement" in Nepal. In this context, efforts of Open Nepal, a collaborative initiative that aims to make government information more accessible to the general public have been monumental. By providing more than 500 datasets through Nepal's first online open data portal, and supporting individuals and governemnt organizations to open up data for the public, the organization has been playing an intrumental role in catalyzing the information ecosystem in Nepal.
